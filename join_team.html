<p> I am looking to recruit an MSc/PhD student to work on Optimization for Machine Learning (stochastic optimization, decision-focused learning) or Reinforcement Learning. The plan is to work at the intersection of theory and practice - developing scalable, robust algorithms with theoretical guarantees on their performance. </p>

<p> If you are a graduate student at SFU, and are interested in working with me, feel free to send me an email. </p>  

<p> If you are applying to graduate school at SFU, and are interested in working with me, please apply at <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/computing/prospective-students/graduate-students/admissions.html">SFU CS</a> and mention my name in your application. I make sure to go through all graduate applications. Typically, emailing me beforehand does not improve your chances of admission. If you do email me, please (i) include your CV, go through my publications, (ii) identify what specific topic you would like to work on and highlight any relevant prior experience (iii) pick a paper on RL/Bandits or Optimization, and summarize it, describing its merits/demerits and possible extensions. Doing a good job on these will increase the probability of my reply and admission to our group. </p>

 <p> Unfortunately, I do not have current openings for postdocs or undergraduate students. </p>

  <!-- <p> I am not recruiting any new graduate students at the moment. Please check back in Fall, 2024. </p> -->
