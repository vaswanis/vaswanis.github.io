  <p> This year, I am only looking to recruit PhD students to work on sequential decision-making (reinforcement learning/bandit problems). The plan is to work at the intersection of theory and practice - developing scalable, robust algorithms with theoretical guarantees on their performance. </p>

  <p> If you are a graduate student at SFU, and are interested in working with me, feel free to send me an email. </p>  

  <!-- <p> I am not recruiting any new graduate students this year. </p> -->
  
  <p> If you are applying to graduate school at SFU, and are interested in working with me, please apply at <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/computing/prospective-students/graduate-students/admissions.html">SFU CS</a> and mention my name in your application. I make sure to go through all graduate applications. Typically, emailing me beforehand does not improve your chances of admission. If you do email me, please (i) include your CV and (ii) go through my publications, pick a paper on RL/Bandits or Optimization, and summarize it, describing its merits/demerits and possible extensions. Doing a good job on this will definitely improve your chances. </p>

  <p> Unfortunately, I do not have current openings for postdocs or undergraduate students. </p>
