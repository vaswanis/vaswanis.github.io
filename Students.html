<p>  <b> For prospective students</b>: I am looking to recruit MSc/PhD students for Fall'22. Topics of interest include sequential decision-making (reinforcement learning/bandit problems) and optimization for machine learning. The plan is to work at the intersection of theory and practice - developing scalable, robust algorithms with theoretical guarantees on their performance. </p>

<p> If you are interested in working with me, please apply to <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/computing/prospective-students/graduate-students/admissions.html">SFU CS</a> and mention my name in your application. The admissions committee will then consult me iff your credentials meet the department requirements. </p>

<p> Typically, emailing me beforehand does not improve your chances of admission. If you do email me, please (i) include your CV and (ii) go through my publications, pick a paper on RL/Bandits or Optimization, and summarize it, describing its merits/demerits and possible extensions. Doing a good job on this will definitely improve your chances, though there are no guarantees and you will still need to meet all the department requirements. <br>

If you have emailed me, I have likely seen your application. Unfortunately, I am unable to respond to every email, and will only reach out to selected students.
