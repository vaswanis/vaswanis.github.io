<p> I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html">School of Computing Science</a> at Simon Fraser University (SFU). My current research interests are in designing better algorithms for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. I am also interested in stochastic optimization and its interplay with generalization in modern machine learning. </p> 

<p> <b>I am looking to recruit PhD students. Please read <a href="https://vaswanis.github.io/join_team.html">this</a> before applying. </b> </p>

<p> In 2020-2021, I was a postdoc in <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html">Computer Science</a> at the University of Alberta  with <a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/">Csaba Szepesvari</a>, and worked on reinforcement learning with constraints and multiple objectives. In 2019-2020, I was a postdoc at <a href="https://mila.quebec/">Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute</a>  with <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~slacoste/">Simon Lacoste-Julien</a>, and worked on stochastic optimization for over-parameterized models. </p>

<p> From 2015-2018, I was a PhD student in <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca">Computer Science</a> at the University of British Columbia (UBC), and was co-supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~laks/">Laks Lakshmanan</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/">Mark Schmidt</a>. My PhD research was on "Structured Bandits and Applications", where we considered problems involving decision-making under uncertainty for applications in social networks and recommender systems. I completed my MSc in Computer Science from UBC in 2015. I was supervised by Laks Lakshmanan and worked on the online and adaptive variants of the influence maximization problem in social networks. </p>

<p> Before coming to UBC, I was a research engineer in the parallel systems group at Siemens Corporate Research in Bangalore. I obtained my Bachelors degree in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/">Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani, India </a> in 2012. </p>
