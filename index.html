<p> I have graduated from UBC and joined the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms, <a href="https://mila.quebec/en">MILA</a> as a postdoc. </p>

<p> From 2015-2018, I was a PhD student co-supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~laks/">Laks Lakshmanan</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/">Mark Schmidt</a>. My PhD research was on "Structured Bandits and Applications", where we considered problems involving decision-making under uncertainty for applications in social networks and recommender systems. </p>

<p> I completed my MSc in Computer Science from UBC in 2015. I was supervised by Laks Lakshmanan and worked on the online and adaptive variants of the influence maximization problem in social networks. </p>

<p> Before coming to UBC, I was a research engineer in the parallel systems group at Siemens Corporate Research in Bangalore. I obtained my Bachelors degree in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/">Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani, India </a> in 2012. </p>
